about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I am a first-year Mathematics and Computer Science major studying at UCSD. I love healthcare and predictive models which is why I want to pursue a career in Data Science.
  
  Previously, I have worked in the areas of Deep Learning and Regression models, having a firm grasp over several programming langauages: Python, Java, R and SQL. I am familiar with serveral tools for this process like TensorFlow and pytorch for Machine Learning and bokeh for interactive plotting.
  
  I currently plan to pursue a masters or even a Phd in this field and I would love to conduct research or work at companies at any time.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
